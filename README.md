# DataApp
React Native app that receives inputs, uploads those inputs to the Firebase, then reads that data and organizes it.

So, to better explain the concept of this app, I have to clarify what this local turist company is.

This attraction is a traditional tourist descent in wicker carts along an old train road in Portugal.

The men who drive the wicker carts write their worker number and the type of trip they are making (trip for 1, 2 or 3 people) on a piece of paper. 
Then, at the end of the day, the boss collects the paper and sees who made the trips and the type of trip they made and calculates the amount of bonus 
that each driver will receive taking into account the number of trips they made and how many people they took on these trips.

Therefore, the app I'm developing comes to optimize this process. 
Instead of writing on paper, the worker enter their numbers and how many people they take on the trip into the app. 
This data is deposited in the Firebase and then read again by the app, which processes this data and at the end delivers documents to the Firebase that say how many
trips each driver has made, the type of trips they have made and how much bonus they will receive for the trips made.

This app is not very far from being finished, so later this year I will have a meeting with the heads of this organization to sell the app.
